## Introduction

This project aims to perform a comparative analysis using visual and sensory data for the detection of potholes. By leveraging both types of data, we aim to enhance the accuracy and reliability of pothole detection systems. The visual data is processed using state-of-the-art object detection models, while sensory data is analyzed using advanced sequence models.

## Datasets

### Public Dataset
- **Source:** Kaggle
- **Number of Images:** 1000
- **Description:** The initial training dataset consists of 1000 images sourced from a public dataset on Kaggle. This dataset provides a variety of road conditions and pothole appearances.

### Private Dataset
- **Collection Area:** Punjab, Pakistan
- **Number of Images:** Initially 1000, extended to 8000
- **Description:** A private dataset was collected from different areas of Punjab, Pakistan. This dataset started with 1000 images and was later extended to 8000 images, providing a comprehensive set of road conditions and pothole examples unique to the region.

## Models Used

### Visual Data
1. **YOLOv8**
   - Description: An advanced version of the You Only Look Once (YOLO) object detection model, known for its speed and accuracy.
   
2. **YOLOv9**
   - Description: The latest iteration in the YOLO series, offering improvements in detection capabilities and efficiency.
   
3. **Faster R-CNN**
   - Description: A highly accurate object detection model that balances speed and precision using region proposal networks.

### Sensory Data
1. **Transformer Model**
   - Description: A deep learning model that leverages attention mechanisms to handle sequential data efficiently and effectively.
   
2. **LSTM Model**
   - Description: A Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network, well-suited for processing and making predictions based on time-series data.

## Methodology

1. **Data Collection and Preprocessing:**
   - Gathered visual data from both public and private datasets.
   - Collected sensory data using appropriate sensors mounted on vehicles.
   - Preprocessed the data for training and testing the models.

2. **Model Training:**
   - Trained YOLOv8, YOLOv9, and Faster R-CNN models using the visual datasets.
   - Trained Transformer and LSTM models using the sensory data.

3. **Evaluation:**
   - Evaluated the performance of each model using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
   - Conducted a comparative analysis to determine the strengths and weaknesses of each approach.

## Results

- Detailed results of the model performances on the test datasets.
- Comparative analysis highlighting the best-performing models for both visual and sensory data.
- Visual representations of model detections and predictions.

## Conclusion

The project successfully demonstrates the potential of combining visual and sensory data for pothole detection. Each model has its strengths, with visual data models excelling in real-time detection and sensory data models providing robust analysis in varying conditions.

## Future Work

- Expand the dataset to include more diverse road conditions and regions.
- Integrate the models into a real-time pothole detection system.
